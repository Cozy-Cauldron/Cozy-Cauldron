Ryan Weisse
3/10
TensorFlow research and setup.

3/11
Basic gesture database is implemented, which has only been populated with “dummy” data. This data serves as a placeholder for the gesture data until we collect testing data with the controller when we begin programming the gestures we want.

3/12
The gesture recognition logic has been integrated, which compares the user-parsed data with the database of pre-coded gestures. Connecting this logic with TensorFlow is the next planned step.

3/14
User-parsed data passes through a basic filter that checks if the data “is real”. The filter eliminates data sets that are composed of strictly 0x00 or strictly 0xff, which indicates the data was collected incorrectly.
