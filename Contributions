-------------------------3/8 - 3/14----------------------------
Weekly Team Meeting: 3/14- All members attended and worked on the pre-alpha report.

Emilie Doan
3/10
Unity setup on personal machine
Completed a beginner 2d Unity tutorial to learn the basics of Unity found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t=220s 
3/11 - 3/12
Worked on a beginner 3d Unity tutorial to learn more about applicable skills in Unity : https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner?uv=2020.3
3/12 - 3/13
Project setup, github integrations, scene and character.

Phillip Somchanhmavong
3/12 ~ 2 hours
Drafted up skeleton report for Pre-Alpha Build and adjusting GitHub repository rulesets involving branches.
3/13 ~ 6 hours
Looking into Magic Wand GitHub documentations/code to try and retool it for our hardware/how to connect it.
3/13 ~ 1 hour
Setting up rough skeleton of hardware concept foundations to form for pre-alpha.
3/14 ~ 5 hours
Drafting up prototypes of hardware component class headers/cpp files for PreAlpha.

Kylie Lennon
3/8
Watched Unity tutorials on how the program is structured and basic functionalities.
3/11
Installed unity and completed a basic 3D tutorial on setting up in game objects.
3/13
Completed object intractability, open/close inventory, put item into inventory functionality, item slot selection in inventory, and item information population on the right side of the inventory.

Ryan Weisse
3/10
TensorFlow research and setup.
3/11
Basic gesture database is implemented, which has only been populated with “dummy” data. This data serves as a placeholder for the gesture data until we collect testing data with the controller when we begin programming the gestures we want.
3/12
The gesture recognition logic has been integrated, which compares the user-parsed data with the database of pre-coded gestures. Connecting this logic with TensorFlow is the next planned step.
3/14
User-parsed data passes through a basic filter that checks if the data “is real”. The filter eliminates data sets that are composed of strictly 0x00 or strictly 0xff, which indicates the data was collected incorrectly.

M Vargo
3/10
Reading more documentation and relevant examples (for I2C, USB, etc.) for Pico W board and IMU.
3/11
Downloaded firmware for Pico board, followed "getting started" guide for the Pico W, and initialized necessary SDK/submodules.
3/13 - 3/14
Soldered header pins to the Pico board and IMU. Read pinouts and connected necessary pins on a breadboard to enable I2C communication.
3/14
Got the Pico to connect correctly and run some examples.
